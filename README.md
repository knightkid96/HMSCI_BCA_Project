 
Abstract
This project focuses on the development of a Hospital Management System (HMS). The system will provide efficient and reliable management of hospital activities such as managing patient information, managing patient health records, managing staff information, and providing financial management. The system will also provide an online portal for patient registration, appointment booking, and online payment. In addition, it will also provide support for various types of reports such as patient records, financials, and staff attendance. The Hospital Management System is intended to be secure, fast, user friendly, and customizable. It is expected that the system will make the clinical and managerial hospital operations run smoothly and This project outlines the design and implementation of a web-based Hospital Management System. The system will provide a secure platform and an easy-to-use interface for managing various departments, including patient records, diagnostic results, scheduling, financial and administrative processes. The system will include modules for managing patient registrations, family and personal information, medical histories, laboratory tests and examinations, admissions and discharges, drug inventories, bills and financials. Additionally, reporting capabilities will be provided for capturing clinical data and providing analytics. The system’s architecture will be built with scalability in mind to allow for future expansion when needed.
















      
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Hospital Management System is an innovative and efficient computerized system that can be used to manage, organize and store the information of hospital patients and staff. It is designed to improve the quality of patient care and facilitate easier access to the resources available at a hospital or any other medical organization. This system allows hospitals to maintain accurate, up-to-date records and information related to patient's health and treatment. In addition, it offers improved functionality, greater automation and increased productivity in managing the day-to-day activities of a hospital. We will discuss the different components of a Hospital Management System, which includes patient record management, appointment scheduling and billing services. Additionally, we will discuss the advantages that such a system offers and how it can help provide optimized patient care.






















1.2	 PROJECT:
The project titled as “Hospital Management System” is developed in HTML and CSS as front end and MySQL as server ,JavaScript and PHP as back end. The main aim of the project is to make a complect solution for Hospital Management System.
1.3 OBJECTIVES:
The main objectives of the application is to design innovative software, which deals with the hospital authority management. The motto of the project is to simplify the job of the administrative people and to provide a user-friendly package.
1.4	 SCOPE:
This application is a built in such a way that the authoritative people can handle their hospital activities and records in a specified manner without any inconvenience.
1.5 EXISTING SYSTEM:
•	Hospitals currently use a manual system for the management and maintenance of critical information. 
•	The current system requires numerous paper forms, with data stores spread throughout the hospital management infrastructure. Often information (on forms) is incomplete, or does not follow management standards. 
•	Forms are often lost in transit between departments requiring a comprehensive auditing process to ensure that no vital information is lost.

1.6 DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM:
•	Multiple copies of the same information exist in the hospital and may lead to inconsistencies in data in various data stores.
•	The Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed for any Hospital to replace their existing manual, paper-based system. The new system is to control the following information; patient information, room availability, staff and operating room schedules, and patient invoices.

1.7 PROPOSED SYSTEM:
•	This project has login module for doctors, admin, patient, nurse, pharmacist, laboratorist and also accountant , adding blood bank details module, nurse details module, accountant module etc.
•	The administrator should enter the username and password to enter into the project. If username and password are mistake, it will say error message. If it is correct, it will show next form.
•	All hospital details are entered in this module. The patients name, patient’s details are entered in this module.
•	The patient’s details can be deleted or modified in this module.
•	The doctor details are entered in this module.
•	The inpatients details like outpatient’s code, inpatients code, patients name, address, pin code, phone no, professional reentered in this module the entered inpatients details can be modified or deleted by the administrator. The patients are selected from the list of inpatients available.
•	The outpatient’s details like register no, date, outpatient no, patient name, departments doctor, consolation fee etc.
•	The doctors, inpatient, outpatient members details are selected from the database and displayed in the form. All inpatient reports and outpatient reports are displayed to the administrator this module.

CHAPTER 3
3.1 SYSTEM ANALYSIS
System analysis is the detailed study of the various operations performed by a system and their relationship within and outside the system. It is a process of collecting and interpreting facts, identifying the problems, and decomposition of a system into its components.
       System analysis is conducted for the purpose of studying a system or its parts in order to identify its objectives. It is a problem-solving technique that improves the system and ensures that all the components of the system work efficiently to accomplish their purpose. Once the analysis is completed, the system analysis has a firm understanding of what is to be done. The next step is to decide how the problem might be solved. Thus, in system design, we move from the logical to physical aspect of the system development life cycle.
  
3.2 LANGUAGE DESCRIPTION

Introduction to HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are three fundamental technologies used in web development. Each technology has its own purpose and plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing and interactive websites. Let's take a closer look at each of these technologies:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML is the backbone of web development. It is a markup language used to structure the content on a web page. HTML uses a series of tags to define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and tables. These tags provide structure to the content and allow browsers to interpret and display the web page correctly.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to apply styles and presentational effects to the HTML elements. With CSS, you can define the appearance of text, colors, layout, and other visual aspects of a web page. It enables you to control the design and layout of multiple web pages from a single style sheet, making it easier to maintain consistency across your website.

Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides pre-built responsive components and styles for building modern and mobile-first websites. It includes a collection of ready-to-use CSS classes and JavaScript components that simplify the process of designing and developing websites. Bootstrap helps in creating responsive layouts, navigation bars, forms, buttons, and much more.
To use Bootstrap, you will need to include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML document and utilize its classes and components in your code.

Introduction to XAMPP
XAMPP is a cross-platform web server that is free and open-source. XAMPP is a short form for Cross-Platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. XAMPP is a popular cross-platform web server that allows programmers to write and test their code on a local webserver. It was created by Apache Friends, and the public can revise or modify its native source code. It includes MariaDB, Apache HTTP Server, and interpreters for PHP and Perl, among other computer languages. Because of XAMPP’s simplicity of deployment, a developer can quickly and easily install a WAMP or LAMP stack on an operating system, with the added benefit that common add-in apps like WordPress and Joomla can also be loaded.


3.3 DATABASE

MySQL SERVER: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for managing and organizing data. It is a reliable and scalable database solution that provides a range of features to efficiently store, query, and manipulate data

Feature of MySQL Server:
•	Relational Database Management System
MySQL follows the relational model of databases, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns. It allows you to define relationships between tables, enforce data integrity, and perform complex queries using the SQL (Structured Query Language) language.

o	ACID Compliance
     ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. MySQL ensures ACID compliance, which guarantees reliable and consistent data transactions. Atomicity ensures that all parts of a transaction are executed or none at all. Consistency ensures that data remains in a valid state during transactions. Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Durability ensures that committed data is permanently stored and can withstand system failures.

o	Scalability and Performance
MySQL can handle high volumes of data and supports efficient scaling options. It supports both vertical scaling (increasing the server's capacity) and horizontal scaling (distributing the load across multiple servers). Additionally, MySQL includes various optimization techniques, such as indexing, query caching, and query optimization, to improve performance.

o	High Availability and Replication
     MySQL supports high availability through features like replication. With replication, data can be replicated across multiple database servers, providing redundancy and ensuring data availability even in the event of server failures. Replication also enables load balancing and read scaling by distributing read queries to replica servers, reducing the load on the primary server.
o	Security
     MySQL offers robust security features to protect your data. It supports user authentication and access control mechanisms, allowing you to define user privileges at a granular level. MySQL also provides encryption options to secure data at rest and during transmission.

o	Data Integrity and Constraints
MySQL allows you to enforce data integrity by defining constraints on your tables. You can specify primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints to ensure data consistency. These constraints help maintain referential integrity and prevent data inconsistencies.

o	Stored Procedures and Triggers
     MySQL supports stored procedures, which are precompiled server-side programs that can be executed on the database server. Stored procedures provide a way to encapsulate complex business logic and improve performance. MySQL also supports triggers, which are database objects that automatically execute in response to specified events, such as inserting, updating, or deleting data in a table.

o	Backup and Recovery
MySQL provides tools and mechanisms for backing up and restoring databases. You can create full backups or incremental backups to ensure data availability and disaster recovery. MySQL also supports point-in-time recovery, allowing you to restore the database to a specific transaction or time.


3.4 FEASIBILITY STUDY:

Feasibility study is made to see if the project on the completion will serve the purpose of the organization for the amount of work, effort and time spent on it. Feasibility study let the developer force the future of the project and the fullness. A feasibility study of the system proposal is accounting to its workability, which is the impact on the organization, ability to meet their uses needs and effective use of resources. Thus, when a new application is proposed, it normally goes through a feasibility study before it is approved for development. The document provides the feasibility of the project that is being designed and lists various areas that were considered very carefully during feasibility study of this project such as technical, economic, and operational feasibilities, and their features are explained as below:
TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY:
The system must be evaluated from technical point view first. The assessment of this feasibility must be based on an outline of the system requirement in terms of input, output, programmers and procedures, having identified an outline system, the investigation must go on to suggest type of the equipment, required for developing the system, and for running the system once it has been designed. 
Technical issues raised during the investigations are:
1.	Does the existing technology sufficient for the suggested one?
2.	Can the system expand if developed?
The project must be developed such that the necessary functions and performances are achieved within the constraints, the project id developed within latest technology, thought the technology may become obsolete after some period of time, due to the fact that newer version of the same software supports the older version, the system may still be used, so. There are minimal constraints involved with the project.
ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY:
The developing system must be justified by cost benefit. Criteria to that the effort is concerned on the project, which will give the best, return at the earliest. Once of the factors, which effect the development of new system, is the cost it would require.
The following are some of the important financial questions asked during the preliminary investigation:
1.	The cost conducts a full system investigation.
2.	The cost of the hardware and software.
3.	The benefits the form of the Reduced cost or fewer costly errors.
Since the system is developed as part of project work, there is no manual cost you spend for the proposed system. Also, all the resources are already available, it is an indication of the system’s economically possible for development.
This includes the following questions:
1.	Is there efficient support for the users?
2.	Will the proposed system cause harm?
The project be beneficial because it satisfies the objectives when development and installed. All behaviors are considered carefully and conclude that the project is behaviorally feasible.

3.5 DATABASE DESIGN:

DATA FLOW DIAGRAM:
A graphical tool used to describe and analysis the movement of data through a system is called data flow diagram. Data flow diagram is the central basic, from which other components are developed, the transformation of data from input to output, through process, may be described logically and independent of the physical components associated with the system.
The DFD is also known as a data flow, graph or a bubble chart.
Types of data flow diagram:
1.	Physical DFD 
2.	Logical DFD
3.	
1.Physical DFD:
Structure analysis state that current system should first understand correctly. This physical DFD is the model of current system and used to ensure that system has been clearly understood. Physical DFD’s shows actual devices, departments and people etc. involved in the current system.

2.Logical DFD:
Logical DFD are the model of proposed system. They clearly should show the requirement on which the new system should be built. Later during the design activity this taken has basis for drawing the system structure charts.
The basic notation used to create DFD’s are as follows:
Data Flow: data move in a specific direction from an origin to a destination. The physical component is not identified.


Source: external source or destination of data, which may be people, organization other entity.



Data Storage: here data are stored or referenced by a processor in the system.
                          



Design: design is the first step in moving from problem domain to the solution domain, Design in especially the bridge between requirement specification and the final solution. The goal of the design process is to produce model for representation of a system, which can be used later to build that system. Thus, produced model is called the “Design of the system.”
It is a solution for the system. In this level the focus is on dividing the module which are needed for the system and the specification models.

CHAPTER 5
5.1 Testing


"Testing is the process of analyzing a software item to detect the differences between existing and required conditions and to evaluate the features of software item". The system is tested under adverse situations and environment to test its performance, reliability and robustness. Verification and validation are done for the system and it is reviewed against each and every customer requirement specification.
The main objectives of testing are:
•	Testing is a process of executing a program with the interest of finding an error.
•	A good test is one that has high probability of finding the yet undiscovered errors.
•	A successful test is the one that has high portability of finding the undiscovered errors.
•	Tests designed to reflect the frequency of user inputs used for reliability estimation.
To test the process two classes of inputs are provided, they are:
a.	A software configuration that includes a software requirement specification, a design specification and source code.
b.	A software configuration that includes a test plan and procedure, any testing tool and test cases and their expected results.
Testing is performed to prove that there are no errors in program. This is extremely difficult since designer cannot prove hundred percent accurate. Therefore, testing is done with a explicit intension of finding errors that make the program fail. Testing has its own cycle.  It requires 5 basic critical factors: planning, project and process management, risk management, inspirits, measurement tools.
5.2 Types of Testing:
           Software testing is a critical element of software quality assurance and represents the ultimate review of specification, design and code generation. there are three types of testing under which a system is tested under different perspectives. They are:
1.	   White box testing
2.	   Black box testing
3.	Alpha Testing
4.	  Beta testing
5.	Clean Room testing
6.	Defect Testing
5.2.1 White Box Testing:
        This is a method of testing software that that tests internal structures or working of an application, as opposed to its functionality. Internal program logic is exercised using this technique. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs. This can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of software testing process.
White box test design techniques include the following code coverage criteria:
•	control flow testing
•	data flow testing
•	branch testing
•	statement coverage
•	decision coverage
•	prime path testing
•	path testing
White box testing uses these above criteria as guidelines to create an error free environment by examining any fragile code. So, these are the building blocks of white box testing. The whole point of white box testing is the ability to know which line of the code is being executed and being able to identify what the correct output should be.
5.2.3 Black box Testing:
        Black box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures and working. Software requirements are exercised using this technique. This method can be applied to every level of software testing. 
Typical black box test design techniques include:
•	decision table testing
•	all-pairs testing
•	equivalence partitioning
•	boundary value analysis
•	cause - effect graph
•	error guessing
•	state transition
•	user story testing 
•	domain analysis 
•	combining technique
Test cases are built around specifications and requirements. Although the tests used are primarily functional in nature, nonfunctional tests may also be used. The test designer selects both valid and invalid inputs and determines the correct output. 
5.3 Test Process:
The general testing process is the creation of a test strategy, creation of test plan/design and the execution of tests. Tests data are the inputs that have been devised to test the system.
Stages in testing process are:
1.	Unit Testing
2.	Module Testing
3.	Sub-System Testing
4.	System Testing
5.	Acceptance Testing












CHAPTER 6
6.1 Validation

At the culmination of integration testing, software is completely assembled as a package, interface error has been uncovered and corrected and final serves of software tests-validation testing may begin. Validation can define in many ways. But a simple definition is that validation succeeds when software function in a manner that can be reasonably expected by the customer, software validation is achieved through a series of black box test that will be used to demonstrate conformity with the requirements. 
A test plan outlines the class tests that will be used to demonstrate the conformity with requirements. Both the plan and procedure are designed to ensure that all the functional requirements are satisfied. All the behavioral characteristics are achieved. All performance requirements are attained documentation is correct and human engineering and other requirements are met.



CHAPTER 7
7.1 System Maintenance

To maintain the long-term effectiveness of the Hospital Management System (HMS), a comprehensive maintenance strategy is essential. A key component of this strategy involves hardware maintenance to ensure that all servers, computers, and networking equipment supporting the HMS function at their optimal levels. Regular hardware checks and replacements prevent unexpected breakdowns and minimize downtime, allowing healthcare facilities to provide uninterrupted services to patients. Additionally, software maintenance plays a crucial role in addressing bugs, errors, and system inefficiencies. Collaborating with the HMS provider to receive regular updates and improvements ensures that the system remains current and aligned with evolving healthcare needs and industry standards. Moreover, implementing robust data management practices is crucial to maintain data integrity and protect sensitive patient information. By regularly purging outdated records, optimizing database performance, and employing data encryption, healthcare institutions can safeguard patient privacy and comply with data protection regulations. Overall, an attentive and proactive approach to HMS system maintenance empowers healthcare organizations to optimize their operations, enhance patient care, and adapt to the ever-changing healthcare landscape effectively.
